            <h2>How to Track a Stolen Phone With IMEI Number</h2>
            <p>The rising instances of phone theft have become a major concern. Losing your phone can be distressing, but when it's stolen, the situation becomes even more worrisome.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Do not share with anyone whether there is GPS tracking device in your car except for the ones you trusted.</li>
                <li>Immediately after installation, memorize your tracker number or write it down in a diary at home or office or anywhere you can easily access it. You can as well save the number in your contact on your phone.</li>
                <li>Remember to communicate with your tracking device on a regular basis. An idle SIM (SIM card in the tracker) for more than 90 days (3 months) will automatically be disconnected by NCC rendering your tracker ineffective.</li>

            <p>Our phones collect extensive data, including our location, which law enforcement can access.</p>
            <p>As phones collect so much information, police can access specific details about your location and whereabouts at any time.</p>
            <p>They can access this data by obtaining a judge’s permission to request it from your mobile service provider, often without your knowledge.</p>
            <p>This may sound worrying, but it’s important to know that there are many restrictions in place that police must follow if they want access to your phone data.</p>
            <p>Under U.S. law, the police must typically obtain a search warrant from a judge, which specifically permits them to track your phone.</p>
